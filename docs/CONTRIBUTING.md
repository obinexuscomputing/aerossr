4. **Lint the code**: Run `npm run lint` to check your code for any linting issues.

5. **Commit your changes**: When you're ready, commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message.

6. **Push your branch**: Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Create a pull request**: Go to the main AeroSSR repository and create a new pull request from your forked branch.

2. **Describe your changes**: In the pull request description, clearly explain the purpose of your changes and any relevant context.

3. **Reference related issues**: If your changes address a specific issue, be sure to reference it in your pull request description.

4. **Await review**: The AeroSSR maintainers will review your pull request. They may ask for additional changes or clarification.

5. **Address feedback**: If the maintainers request changes, address them in your branch and push the updates to your pull request.

6. **Merge your changes**: Once your pull request is approved, the maintainers will merge your changes into the main AeroSSR repository.
